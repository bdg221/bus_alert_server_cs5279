# Bus Alert Mobile Client

Bus Alert is a service that provides notifications to students and guardians upon the arrival of the bus to the student's
bus stop. This server piece contains the REST APIs which will be called by the mobile client. The server piece also includes
the logic for processing the GPS coordinates of a bus and respond with a notification when appropriate.

## Installation
The repository can be cloned locally and opened in a local IDE. I am using IntelliJ.
